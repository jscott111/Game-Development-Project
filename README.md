# Game-Development-Project
This is the final project for my Game Development course.

All of the files for the project are available for editing in Unity. Clone the entire repository and place in local folder, open that folder in Unity and presto.

To run the game without going through Unity, all you need is to download the 'Build' folder and execute the file '2D Project Test.exe' to play the game.
